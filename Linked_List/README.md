# 📚 Linked List Overview (Java)

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure made up of **nodes**, each containing data and a pointer to the next node.

---

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List** – Nodes point forward.  
- **Doubly Linked List** – Nodes point forward and backward.  
- **Circular Linked List** – Last node points back to first.  
- **Doubly Circular Linked List** – Bidirectional circular structure.

---

## Core Operations

1. Insert  
2. Delete  
3. Traversal  
4. Search  
5. Update  
6. Count  
7. Reverse  
8. Sort  
9. Merge  

---

## Advantages

- Dynamic size  
- Efficient insertion/deletion  
- Maintains insertion order  

---

## Disadvantages

- Extra memory for pointers  
- Sequential access only  
- More complex than arrays
